Student project "Bzik"
===========

## Presentation ##

I realized this project with two other students : Thomas LELIEVRE and Vincent PERILLAT in licence professionnelle METINET at the University of Lyon (France) in 2014.<br />
It was an innovative project, we had to create a platform for races bike online. Users can connect, connect their bikes with an ANT + sensor and participate in virtual races against other players anywhere in the world.<br />
The Data transmitted via the ANT + technology are used simultaneously to adjust the playback speed of an immersive video of the race and on the application in order to establish a ranking of players during the course and at the end.
